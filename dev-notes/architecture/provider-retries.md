title: "Provider Retry Events"
---

Tau retries transient provider failures in `tau_ai`, where HTTP status codes and
transport exceptions are visible. This keeps retry classification out of
`tau_agent` while still allowing the portable agent loop to surface progress.

## What Was Added

Provider adapters can emit `ProviderRetryEvent` before retrying a failed request.
The event includes the next attempt number, total attempts, delay, a
human-readable message, and structured diagnostic data.

`run_agent_loop()` maps that provider event to `RetryEvent`, a provider-neutral
agent event consumed by renderers and TUI adapters.

## Behavior

OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and OpenAI Codex subscription providers retry
transient status codes such as `408`, `409`, `429`, and `5xx` responses before
surfacing a final provider error. The default is two retries, for three total
request attempts.

Backoff is short, exponential, and capped by `max_retry_delay_seconds`.
Cancellation is checked during the backoff delay so Escape/TUI cancellation does
not wait for the entire retry sleep to finish.

Anthropic may also encode an error event inside an otherwise successful HTTP 200 SSE response. Tau retries `api_error`, `overloaded_error`, `rate_limit_error`, and `timeout_error` stream events only when no content has been emitted and the retry budget remains. Exhausted errors retain the upstream event and attempt count; non-transient errors and errors after partial content are surfaced without replaying output. This behavior corresponds to upstream `809e0e6`, adapted to Tau Prime's existing provider-neutral retry events.

## Rendering

Transcript, final-text CLI mode, and TUI renderers show retry progress as subtle
status output. Final text mode still prints only the final assistant response on
stdout; retry progress goes to stderr.

## Boundary

`tau_agent` does not decide whether an HTTP response is retryable. It only
forwards `RetryEvent` as portable progress. Provider-specific details stay in
the adapter's `data` payload for diagnostics.
